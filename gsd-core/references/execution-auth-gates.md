## Authentication Gates

Auth errors during execution are NOT failures — they're expected interaction points.

**Indicators:** "Not authenticated", "Unauthorized", 401/403, "Please run {tool} login", "Set {ENV_VAR}"

**Protocol:**
1. Recognize auth gate (not a bug)
2. STOP task execution
3. Create dynamic checkpoint:human-action with exact auth steps
4. Wait for user to authenticate
5. Verify credentials work
6. Retry original task
7. Continue normally

**Example:** `vercel --yes` → "Not authenticated" → checkpoint asking user to `vercel login` → verify with `vercel whoami` → retry deploy → continue

**In Summary:** Document as normal flow under "## Authentication Gates", not as deviations.
